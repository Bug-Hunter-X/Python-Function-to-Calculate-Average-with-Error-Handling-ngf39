# Python Average Calculator with Improved Error Handling

This repository contains a Python function designed to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  The initial version had a flaw: it didn't handle empty lists or lists containing non-numeric values. This improved version addresses these issues, providing more robust error handling.

## Files

* `bug.py`: Demonstrates the original code with its limitations.
* `bugSolution.py`: Shows the improved code with error handling.

## Usage

The functions in both files take a list of numbers as input and return the average. The updated version gracefully manages cases with empty lists or non-numeric entries.
